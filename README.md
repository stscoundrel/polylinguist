# Polylinguist

More exact language usage stats from Github profile.

Features:
- No limits like only "top 10 languages"
- Both public & private repos via access token
- Aliasing similar languages to same stats. For example, combine C & C++ to C/C++
- Ignoring languages. For example, drop markup like SCSS, HTML, Twig etc.
- Ignoring repositories. For example, drop a repository that contains megabytes of generated code, skewing statistics.

## Install
